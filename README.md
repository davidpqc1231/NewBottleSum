#### Temporary code instructions:

Note: We are still working on improving this codes' implementation.

To run bottleSumEx with the same settings as ours:

```
python bottleEx_summarize.py -S1_path <S1FILE> -S2_path <S2FILE> -S3_path <S3FILE> -rem_words 3 -out_name <OUTNAME>
```
S1FILE contains the original sentences. S2FILE contains the next sentences of the original ones. S3FILE includes the title of the original sentences' corresponding text.
