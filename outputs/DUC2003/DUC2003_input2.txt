 about half of 12 patients studied said their hallucinations became much less severe after the treatment, which feels like ``having a woodpecker knock on your head'' once a second for up to 16 minutes, said researcher dr. ralph hoffman.
 a team led by dr. linda brzustowicz, an assistant professor of neuroscience at rutgers university's center for molecular and behavioral neuroscience in newark, studied the dna of dozens of members of 22 families in which multiple generations suffered from schizophrenia.
 the study may help scientists develop drugs to treat schizophrenia and to help people stop smoking, said dr. tony george, the lead author of the study.
the finding raises doubts about the increasing number of cesarean sections performed for convenience.
the study, published in thursday's issue of the new england journal of medicine, found that having a parent or a sibling with schizophrenia increased a person's chances of developing the illness by about sevenfold to ninefold.
but a new study suggests that young men who will develop the disease may be identifiable even before any symptoms appear.
now researchers are beginning, in a systematic way, to investigate the earliest stages of schizophrenia, attempting to find signs that could predict its onset.
people with schizophrenia often display what psychiatrists describe as a ``blunting'' of emotional response that makes it difficult for them to relate to others.
the occurrence of wrinkles and creases in the palm, and ridge dissociation in the finger and palm were much higher among schizophrenic patients than in mentally-healthy adults, according to psychiatrist feng zhiying, the head of the research group.
more than 1 million soldiers, militiamen and reservists have been drafted into flood control efforts in four provinces in south and east china as flood levels on the yangtze reached levels unseen in more than four decades.
with the yangtze at record levels and threatening to rise further, officials were preparing to divert floodwaters along a section of the 6,300-kilometer- (3,900-mile-) long river described as the most dangerous.
the government, meanwhile, announced a ban on logging in western sichuan province along the upper reaches of the river to curb severe soil erosion.
another flood crest rolled down the yangtze river, china's longest river.
dikes protecting major cities were holding, but the surge this week from rain-swollen upper yangtze river tributaries would likely keep floodwaters high for weeks, state media reported.
wang jun, a senior engineer with the hydrological bureau of the yangtze river water control committee, said due to the abnormal movement of the rain front, the rainy season has remained longer than usual in the valley along the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze.
torrential rain in the upper reaches of the river will prolong dangerously high water levels in the middle and lower reaches for the foreseeable future, according to ji xuewu, director of the hydrological department under the yangtze river water conservancy committee.

the yangtze river water level at a measuring point in chongqing, in the upper reaches, hit 180 meters at 2 p.m. today, which is as high as the official danger mark.
the warning came from li antian, director of the yangtze river water resources committee (yrwrc), who said there is a high probability that the upper river valley will experience bigger floods than last year.
heavy rains in areas along the yangtze river basin and water from the upper reaches of the yangtze have combined to form the third and highest flood peak this year, pushing water levels at the middle and lower reaches close to the record high of last year.
schulz, 77, who has written, drawn, colored and lettered every ``peanuts'' strip for almost 50 years, decided to retire after being diagnosed with colon cancer in november.
``it's real sad.
the two-story museum, replete with several galleries to display schulz's mind-boggling body of work and an 11,600-square-foot courtyard, will be built in santa rosa across the street from the redwood empire ice arena that schulz built in 1969.
today charles m. schulz bids farewell to his daily installments of ``peanuts'' with the letter to readers, bringing to a close the half-century run of the world's most beloved comic strip.
it's strange to see an adult drawn by schulz _ shock of white hair, soft smile, bright eyes, clearly a grown-up.
he was 77.
fellow cartoonists had hoped to surprise schulz with the salute, which they set in motion before he became ill in november.
charles m. schulz's ``peanuts'' would mark its 50th anniversary in 2000, and ``sparky'' himself would get a lifetime achievement award.
the department is looking into whether people who use ebay to sell items falsely labeled some sports memorabilia as ``one-of-a-kind,'' a source close to the investigation told the associated press tuesday.
on the explosive frontier of internet auctions, the policy is different: bidder beware.
new york city consumer authorities confirmed yesterday that they are ``actively investigating complaints regarding alleged fraudulent sales'' at online auctioneers.
singularly successful ebay, already a legend on wall street, is raising some $1.11 billion in part to spur its international expansion in the business of selling a huge range of goods.
it's unclear, though, whether it's going to work.
for now, the new site, www.ebay-autotrader.com, lists only 2,100 used cars, for sale by their owners or by dealers.
the mother of all web auction sites is ebay, a place where many web users first learned of the excitement of an online auction.
finally this week, after years of denials, the government admitted it did use pyrotechnic devices the day the davidian's mount caramel compound burned down, killing david koresh and about 80 followers.
this is no time to ``play one off against the other,'' she said.
that evidence, rep. henry waxman charged monday, was overlooked by rep. dan burton, the house republican who is leading a new inquiry into the government's deadly standoff with the branch davidians -- and who has accused attorney general janet reno and the justice department of possibly concealing the truth from congress and the public.
that simple mistake by a ''very junior'' lawyer helped lead to the controversy over whether the government was trying to hide the fact the three canisters were fired, special counsel john danforth told a senate judiciary subcommittee.
``yeah, the military gas did not penetrate that, uh, bunker where the bus was,'' reports charlie one, an agent inside a bradley fighting vehicle.
